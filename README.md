# Course Folders

Utility to generate nested directories for my courses at the beginning of the semester. Works
by prompting the user for the number of courses they're taking, then prompting them for the 
course code and title of each course.

In the future, I'd like to make the generated sub-directories more customizable, maybe with a config
file that's straightforward to edit, or even within the CLI.
